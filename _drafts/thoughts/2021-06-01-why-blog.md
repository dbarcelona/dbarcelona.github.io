# I am a structured thinker.

Or at least I think that I am. With this in mind, here are the x reasons why I decided to start blogging.

**1. Inspiration**

I was recently paired up with [Sarina Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarinachen/), a Berkeley IEOR grad, as part of a mentorship program and she has been wonderful. In addition to the valuable help she has imparted about exploring different industries and doing co-ops, I learned she has created her own website [ifcolorful.com](https://ifcolorful.com) to showcase her own personal projects. I highly recommend looking through her posts on [Disney IE](https://ifcolorful.com/theme-park-infographics/), which made me even more interested in IEOR, and [College Football](https://ifcolorful.com/college-football/), for the the phrase "Circle of Suck."

[Peter Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjz) is another incredible human being who I have drawn much inspiration from for this website. I decided to use Jekyll to create my website due to its relative ease (ha, more on that later) and read through all of his posts to help structure my first few ideas here. Two of his posts that really made me think, "Wow, I should really be doing that" are [Tracking Time](https://peterzhang.info/time-tracking) and [Budgeting](https://peterzhang.info/budgeting).

**2. New Challenge**

5 years ago, I made a website about the San Antonio Spurs for a computer science class and it was bad. Well, not too bad because I got an 86 on the project, but the HTML-only site was my only exposure to web development until about a week ago.
