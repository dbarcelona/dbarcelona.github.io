**<a name="monday">Monday, June 28th - Vaccines</a>**

I went into an office building and got a taste of the in-person corporate environment for the first time ever. I interacted with strangers for the first time in about 16 months without fear of getting sick but instead with the typical fear of forgetting people's names immediately after meeting them. I am grateful for vaccines and their ability to let me focus on all the other things that scare me on a daily basis.

**<a name="tuesday">Tuesday, June 29th - Crash Course US History</a>**

My 7th grade social studies (history) teacher phoned in the second half of the year so he decided to show us Crash Course US History most class days. In a way, he, a tall, Caucasian teacher, replaced himself with John Green, a tall, Caucasian teacher. I am grateful for Crash Course US History, its ability to prepare me for 8th grade history, and its ability to educate, entertain, and remind 8 years later.
