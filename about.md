# Who Am I?

My name is Duncan Barcelona and I am a Chinese-Filipino American who shares a first name with a [murdered Scottish king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Duncan) and a last name with a [popular Catalonian city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona). Although I was named after the [greatest power forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan) in NBA history, I do also enjoy my fair share of Dunkin' Donuts (now known as [Dunkin'](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20180925)) but I would probably pick an Original Glazed from Krispy Kreme if I had a choice.

I originally hail from the suburbs of New York, growing up as the eldest child of immigrant parents and the older brother to 3 younger siblings. Some highlights from my childhood (before high school) include becoming a [black belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soo_Bahk_Do), scoring 20 points in a basketball game, playing bass guitar while singing my heart out, and visiting family in the Philippines.

After going to public school though 8th grade, I was admitted to [Regis High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_High_School_(New_York_City))

an alummus of [Regis High School] in NYC, and I secretly think Times Square is one of the best places in the world (but don't tell other New Yorkers).

I am currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley, majoring in both [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu), minoring in [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/) if I have the time.

I am on the search for Spring/Summer 2022 opportunities related to operations, business analytics, and/or data science. If you know of any opportunities, please feel free to [let me know](mailto:dbarcelona@berkeley.edu)!

I am 24601.
