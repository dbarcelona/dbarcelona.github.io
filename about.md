# Who Am I?

I am a proud Chinese-Filipino American who shares a first name with a dead Scottish king and a last name with a popular Catalonian city.

I am originally from the suburbs of New York, an alummus of [Regis High School](https://regis.org) in NYC, and I secretly think Times Square is one of the best places in the world (but don't tell other New Yorkers).

I am currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley, majoring in both [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu), minoring in [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/) if I have the time.

I am on the search for Spring/Summer 2022 opportunities related to operations, business analytics, and/or data science. If you know of any opportunities, please feel free to [let me know](mailto:dbarcelona@berkeley.edu)!

I am 24601.
