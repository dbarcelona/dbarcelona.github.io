# Who Am I?

> “Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best.” - Tim Duncan

My name is Duncan Barcelona and I am a Chinese-Filipino American who shares a first name with a [murdered Scottish king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Duncan) and a last name with a [popular Catalonian city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona). Although I was named after the [greatest power forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan) in NBA history, I do also enjoy my fair share of Dunkin' Donuts (now known as [Dunkin'](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20180925)) but I would probably pick an Original Glazed from Krispy Kreme if I had a choice.

I originally hail from the suburbs of New York, growing up as the eldest child of immigrant parents and the older brother to 3 younger siblings. Some highlights from my childhood (before high school) include becoming a [black belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soo_Bahk_Do), scoring [20 points](https://theislandnow.com/news-98/st-marys-collects-three-wins/) in a basketball game, singing/rapping "The Show Goes On" to win a chorus class America's Got Talent, and eating lechon with my extended family in the Philippines.

After going to public school though 8th grade, I was admitted to [Regis High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_High_School_(New_York_City)), which greatly helped me grow into the person I am today. Some highlights from my high school days include making 3 costume changes in 1 night to perform with various music groups, having my name chanted in a packed basketball gym, and throwing shaving cream in the face of the Dean of Students.

Currently, I am a rising junior at UC Berkeley, majoring in both [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu), and minoring in [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/), if I have the time. Outside of classes, I have joined a new organization every semester at Cal, which has helped me learn more about [IEOR](https://iise.berkeley.edu/), [consulting](http://voyagerconsulting.org/), [teaching data science](https://bd.berkeley.edu/), and [DEI work](https://berkeleyhbsa.org/) while expanding my network along the way.

I am uncertain what my future will look like, but I am excited for whatever comes next in my journey. I am on the search for Spring/Summer 2022 internship opportunities related to operations, business analytics, and/or data science. If you would like to help me out in my search, I am grateful for your assistance, unsure why you are spending your time reading my blog, and very open to [hearing from you](mailto:dbarcelona@berkeley.edu)!

Finally, as a fan of musical theater, the only correct answer to the question "Who Am I?" is [2-4-6-0-1](https://genius.com/Claude-michel-schonberg-who-am-i-lyrics)!
