# Like clique essays, I will begin this post with a definition.

Perfectionism is the refusal to accept any standard short of perfection or a philosophical doctrine that religious, moral, social, or political perfection is attainable, according to a quick Google search.

I don't think I am a perfectionist but writing essays is a struggle. I am aware that I am not the best writer in the world -- I may or may not use punctuation correctly -- but whenever I sit down to write a paper for class, I constantly write and rewrite the same sentence over and over again until I end up with an overly long sentence with too many commas, just like this one. I do this, however, in the hope of writing a perfect sentence that my professor, or more likely tired college student grader, will be awed by and give me a good grade.

Ever since elementary school when I learned about how to construct paragraphs, I have been taught how to have a rough draft and then edit, and edit, and edit until you end up with an essay better your first try. Unfortunately, the demon known as procrastination struck me during high school, which led to nearly 4 years' worth of essays written without rough drafts but good results. I would start out by re-re-re-rewriting my sentences until I take a peek at my clock and realize that writing at 2am is probably not as beneficial as getting 3 hours of sleep before speedrunning the rest of my paper while trying to maintain my balance on the C train.

Once I arrived to college, I was greeted by the fact that engineering majors do not need to write essays, which I was actually a little sad about. Despite my years of essay procrastination, I was missing out on the heart-pounding, blood-rushing experience of submitting an essay seconds before the deadline and problems sets weren't giving me the same rush. So, I decided to take an English class in college. Did I learn from my high school mistakes? Nope, not at all.

My website posts are divided into [stories](stories), which will be more like those carefully written and rewritten sentences, and [thoughts](thoughts), which, as you might guess, will be more like those sentences written hastily while blocking out the loud mariachi band that just walked on the 7 train. I promise I will try not to rewrite my thoughts too much if you promise you will read my half-coherent thoughts. Cool? Cool. Cool!
