# I am currently overthinking as I write this and it's not great.

Overthinking about my future, my past, what I should be doing, what I should not be doing and more. My brain feels like it is at the wheel sometimes and my emotions are just there, hanging on for a ride.

While my mind is at this state of unease, I helpfully remember one of the most helpful things that I learned during high school: how to do a brain dump. At one point in my senior year, my music teacher came into my Advanced Music Theory class of about 8 people and told us to open our computers or notebooks. Then, he told us to open up a Word doc or Google doc or grab a piece of paper and a pencil/pen. Then, he told us to write whatever came into our heads, any thought, any idea, any piece of stress or joy in our brain, write it all out. And do that for 5 minutes.

Doing this for the first time, I found it very unnatural to listen to my brain, as I am usually caught up in many different things throughout the day that distract my mind from the feelings and emotions inside of me that I tend to ignore them. Most of the time that is by listening to some sort of music or YouTube video or podcast so I don't have too much alone time with my thoughts. This process really makes me stop and begin to process what is going on with me. Although my first intention would be to figure out how to solve my issues, I try to resist and let my brain just unload all the stuff that's been hidden and held up in there for weeks.

Once you finish unloading all your thoughts, it is up to you to decide what to do with your list of thoughts. I haven't looked back at mine from senior year, but I am sure a lot of those concerns I had back then probably figured themselves out given time. I just finished up another brain dump and right now, some of those issues seem like they may not work themselves out, but hey, that's what I said about the last list.
