# I liked standing on trains and my friends disagreed.

I went to high school in NYC, so I took the LIRR home for 4 years. With that volume of trips, I was bound to not find a seat on the train on occasion. This is my letter of recommendation for this experience.

It happened for the first time midway through my freshman year. “The time is 5:11. Please watch the closing train doors on Track 17.” As I heard this message on the PA, I turned on the jets and bolted down the stairs of Penn Station. As I slid between the closing doors, I thought to myself, “I made it!” I soon regretted my decision to hop onto the train when I glanced at the seats and noticed that every single one was taken. Commuters were sitting shoulder to shoulder with each other. I even ventured to other train cars and all were crammed with nearly eighty people each. When I realized that my search for seats was futile, I gave up and joined the numerous businessmen planted on the sides of the vestibule. Then, I placed my backpack on the floor and thought, “What can I do for the next half hour?” My usual options were either to sleep or to get some work done but since the possibility of sleep was out of the question, I opened up Homer’s Odyssey and began my own “nostos.”

Later that afternoon, I stepped into my mom’s Honda Odyssey and immediately complained to her. My feet were sore beyond belief due to my attempt to maintain my balance on the rocking train car. I could not even focus on Homer’s illustrious words with my entire body swaying back and forth with the train. Time moved at a snail’s pace and the thirty-minute ride turned into an eternity. Standing appeared to be infinitely worse than sitting and I vowed that I would try to avoid standing on the train ever again.

The following day, I asked my fellow Long Island commuters if they had experienced similar situations. Most of them did and they all hated it as well. Every single person complained about their aching feet and their inability to do anything besides just standing there. Less than two weeks later, I found myself in the same position. I cursed my luck but ended up gaining a new perspective on the once agonizing stand.

It was the day before a “Faculty In-Service Day” so homework was completely absent from my mind. Due to fatigue and overall laziness, I forwent the bothersome search for a seat, knowing it would prove to be useless once again. I accepted my fate and leaned up against the side of the vestibule. Across from me stood a middle-aged man in a full suit, carrying a briefcase by his side. Suddenly, we made eye-contact and he remarked, “Hey, I went to that school.” After a moment of confusion, I looked down at my Regis sweatshirt and realized that he was talking to me. What followed was a twenty-minute conversation with a Regis alum about how the school has changed and the lessons he had learned from there. Once he departed at Bayside, I felt that I had gotten to know an entirely new person and yet, there was still ten minutes remaining on my journey. As the train passed by Douglaston and Little Neck, I glanced out the windows of the train and I was instantly mesmerized. In the glorious landscape I witnessed, the setting sun illuminated the water with a glittering radiance that forever etched the scene into my memory. At this point, I had been taking the train for almost six months but I never realized how beautiful the surrounding scenery was. Being forced to stand opened my eyes to the other commuters and the remarkable beauty in my surroundings that I had foolishly ignored.

For most of my LIRR commuting friends, they unfortunately do not share the same fascination with standing on the train. They ask me questions like, “Why would I stand when there are perfectly good seats there?” or “Why would you like standing?” or even claim, “Standing is objectively bad.” My response to them: standing provides you with a sense of freedom and power. While sitting confines you to a 2’ x 3’ x 4’ area, standing allows you to roam about the wider vestibule. Sitting on a crowded train imprisons you in a cell with either one or two other bodies. On top of that, there is a sensation of power that comes over me when I stand and look out the train’s windows. My feeling of power is that of a proud king’s, looking over at his kingdom. My artists have created pieces of artwork that are meant for my eyes to see in the form of graffiti. My architects have created houses and skyscrapers that capture the attention of all and provide shelter for millions. My engineers have created this railroad that gives me a front row seat to all the wonders of the world. Standing in the midst of my dominion, I leave my irritating thoughts of work and sleep behind and enter the beautiful reality that surrounds me.

Nowadays, I occasionally forgo sitting on my LIRR ride home, even when there are open seats available. When people ask me why I still do this, I must admit that it does take me a few seconds to remember the reason. I first think back of my first standing experience with foot pains on an everlasting trip. Those pains soon morph into the majestic colors of the unforgettable sunset that will stay with me forever. Then, I remember.
