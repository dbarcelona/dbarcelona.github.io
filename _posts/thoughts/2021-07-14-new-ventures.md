# Don't you just hate when you keep starting up new ventures?

In my imagination, this would be an issue that I face regularly, but most of my ideas are kept hidden from the world in a iPhone note or a markdown file only accessible by me and any of my hackers.

This thought came across my mind when I was talking with my new apartment-mate today and he kept listing all the different projects that he was up to. Some people, like him based on limited interaction, are able to balance all of these different ventures in a number of different fields. I am not one of those people. I tend to either lack execution due to "more pressing" things like school, work, and internship recruiting, or put all my attention into 1 project for an extended period of time.

This idea has been evident recently with the [Gratitude](gratitude) section of my website, where I have been writing everyday, but have also forgotten/ignored [Stories](stories) and [Thoughts](thoughts) for a number of weeks. I also just finished my first 30 days of work and moved to a new city, so maybe that's a factor as well.

I am 5 months away from turning 21 and I have some projects that I want to finish by then. I have the luxury of not having to worry about school (since I am taking the semester off) and work (my company actually values work-life balance), although internship recruitment still exists. Nonetheless, here are the things I want to do and I promise to give an update on these as time passes.

1. A [Jon Bois](https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois)/[Secret Base](https://www.youtube.com/user/sbnation)-like video on the beauty of the 2013-14 San Antonio Spurs
2. A [vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)-like video series or "Dear Hank and John"-like podcast with me and my siblings
3. A song that still sounds correct when [every other beat is missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9RZ15UHInE)

Am I overestimating the amount of work this will be? I guess we will find out in a bit.
