# Life is better than humans give it credit for.

Or, to put it another way, I take things for granted. While going through my daily life, I tend to gravitate towards the things that are going wrong, instead of being grateful for all the things that I have been given. As an attempt to force myself to see the good, I will be posting weekly gratitude updates to hold myself accountable. Who knows, maybe you are grateful for some of these things too.
