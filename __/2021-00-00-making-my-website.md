5 years ago, I made a website about the San Antonio Spurs for a computer science class and it was bad. Well, not too bad because I got an 86 on the project, but the HTML-only site was my only exposure to web development until about a week ago when I decided to start making this site.

In theory, this should not have been as difficult as it ended up being. I've taken a few coding classes in the past few years and am an *aspiring engineer* but I have realized that this can be a little tough. My programming friends frequently tell me that one of the most helpful skills to have is knowing what to Google in order to figure out your issues.

I started out with watching Codecademy (which I originally thought was *Codeacademy*) videos on YouTube to reacqaint myself with HTML and learn about CSS. When I realized the ridiculous amount of work it would have been to code my own site from scratch
